# Pebble-Banner
CloudPebble sources for the Banner App (Show very large scrolling characters/texts on the Pebble watch)

banner.zip contains all the files for the banner app, just do an "Import" in CloudPebble and you will have all the sources available
(or unzip and store the files in your "Make" folder)

banner-example.zip can be imported in CloudPebble and shows a working example of How to use the "Scroll" function in your own App.

The fonttable folder contains all software to create a different Banner Font Table. Currently the Banner Font Table contains
all UTF-8 characters, if you want to support other languages then you will have to create a different table.
